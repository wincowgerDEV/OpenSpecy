\arguments{
\item{file}{Character vector with path to file(s).}

\item{share}{defaults to \code{NULL}; needed to share spectra with the
Open Specy community; see \code{\link{share_spec}()} for details.}

\item{metadata}{a named list of the metadata; see details below.}

\item{type}{Character vector of spectra types to extract from OPUS binary
file. Default is `"spec"`, which will extract the final spectra, e.g.
expressed in absorbance (named `AB` in Bruker OPUS programs). Possible
additional values for the character vector supplied to `type` are `"spec_no_atm_comp"` (spectrum of the sample without compensation for atmospheric gases, water vapor and/or carbon dioxide),
`"sc_sample"` (single channel spectrum of the sample measurement), `"sc_ref"` (single channel spectrum of the reference measurement),
`"ig_sample"` (interferogram of the sample measurement) and `"ig_ref"`
(interferogram of the reference measurement).}

\item{simplify}{Logical (defaults to `FALSE`): if set to `TRUE`, returns a flattened list.
The first element of that list (`wavenumbers`) is the wavenumbers of the first file read.
The second element (`spectra`) is a matrix of the corresponding spectra. Especially useful when
passing more than one file to the `file` option, for example to read a suite of spectral file.
directly into a matrix.
If the files do not have the same number of wavebands, the wavebands of the very first file passed to `file` is used as a reference for linear interpolation.}

\item{wns_digits}{Integer that specifies the number of decimal places used to round
the wavenumbers (values of x-variables) if `simplify = TRUE`.}

\item{atm_comp_minus4offset}{Logical whether spectra after atmospheric compensation are read with
an offset of -4 bytes from Bruker OPUS files. Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
The output of `read_opus()` depends on the value of the `simplify` option used in the function call.

 - If `simplify = FALSE` (default), `read_opus()` returns a list of 10 elements:
    - `metadata`: a `data.frame` containing metadata from the OPUS file
    - `spec` If `"spec"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `spec_no_atm_comp` If `"spec_no_atm_comp"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the spectrum of the sample without background compensation (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `sc_sample` If `"sc_sample"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the single channel spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `sc_ref` If `"sc_ref"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the single channel spectrum of the reference (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `ig_sample` If `"ig_sample"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the interferogram of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `ig_ref`  If `"ig_ref"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the interferogram of the reference (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `wavenumbers` If `"spec"` or `"spec_no_atm_comp"` was requested in the `type` option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `wavenumbers_sc_sample` If `"sc_sample"` was requested in the `type` option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the single channel spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
    - `wavenumbers_sc_ref` If `"sc_ref"` was requested in the `type` option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the single channel spectrum of the reference (otherwise set to `NULL`).

 - If `simplify = TRUE`, a list of two elements is returned:
    - `wavenumbers`: Numeric vector with wavenumbers of the requested spectra.
    - `spectra`: Matrix with spectra of requested type (see argument `type`).

\description{
Read file(s) acquired with a Bruker Vertex FTIR Instrument.
}
\details{
The type of spectra returned by the function when using `type = "spec"` depends on the setting of the Bruker instrument: typically, it can be either absorbance or reflectance.

The type of spectra to extract from the file can also use Bruker's OPUS software naming conventions, as follows:

- `ScSm` corresponds to `sc_sample`
- `ScRf` corresponds to `sc_ref`
- `IgSm` corresponds to `ig_sample`
- `IgRf` corresponds to `ig_ref`
