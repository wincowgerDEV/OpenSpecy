#' @title Read spectral data from Bruker OPUS binary files
#'
#' @description
#' Read file(s) acquired with a Bruker Vertex FTIR Instrument.
#'
#' @param file Character vector with path to file(s).
#' @param share defaults to \code{NULL}; needed to share spectra with the
#' Open Specy community; see \code{\link{share_spec}()} for details.
#' @param metadata a named list of the metadata; see details below.
#' @param type Character vector of spectra types to extract from OPUS binary
#' file. Default is `"spec"`, which will extract the final spectra, e.g.
#' expressed in absorbance (named `AB` in Bruker OPUS programs). Possible
#' additional values for the character vector supplied to `type` are `"spec_no_atm_comp"` (spectrum of the sample without compensation for atmospheric gases, water vapor and/or carbon dioxide),
#' `"sc_sample"` (single channel spectrum of the sample measurement), `"sc_ref"` (single channel spectrum of the reference measurement),
#' `"ig_sample"` (interferogram of the sample measurement) and `"ig_ref"`
#' (interferogram of the reference measurement).
#'
#' @param simplify Logical (defaults to `FALSE`): if set to `TRUE`, returns a flattened list.
#'   The first element of that list (`wavenumbers`) is the wavenumbers of the first file read.
#'   The second element (`spectra`) is a matrix of the corresponding spectra. Especially useful when
#'   passing more than one file to the `file` option, for example to read a suite of spectral file.
#'   directly into a matrix.
#'   If the files do not have the same number of wavebands, the wavebands of the very first file passed to `file` is used as a reference for linear interpolation.
#' @param wns_digits Integer that specifies the number of decimal places used to round
#'   the wavenumbers (values of x-variables) if `simplify = TRUE`.
#' @param atm_comp_minus4offset Logical whether spectra after atmospheric compensation are read with
#'   an offset of -4 bytes from Bruker OPUS files. Default is `FALSE`.
#'
#' @details The type of spectra returned by the function when using `type = "spec"` depends on the setting of the Bruker instrument: typically, it can be either absorbance or reflectance.
#'
#' The type of spectra to extract from the file can also use Bruker's OPUS software naming conventions, as follows:
#'
#' - `ScSm` corresponds to `sc_sample`
#' - `ScRf` corresponds to `sc_ref`
#' - `IgSm` corresponds to `ig_sample`
#' - `IgRf` corresponds to `ig_ref`
#'
#' @return The output of `read_opus()` depends on the value of the `simplify` option used in the function call.
#'
#'  - If `simplify = FALSE` (default), `read_opus()` returns a list of 10 elements:
#'     - `metadata`: a `data.frame` containing metadata from the OPUS file
#'     - `spec` If `"spec"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `spec_no_atm_comp` If `"spec_no_atm_comp"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the spectrum of the sample without background compensation (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `sc_sample` If `"sc_sample"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the single channel spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `sc_ref` If `"sc_ref"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the single channel spectrum of the reference (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `ig_sample` If `"ig_sample"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the interferogram of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `ig_ref`  If `"ig_ref"` was requested in the `type` option, a matrix of the interferogram of the reference (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `wavenumbers` If `"spec"` or `"spec_no_atm_comp"` was requested in the `type` option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `wavenumbers_sc_sample` If `"sc_sample"` was requested in the `type` option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the single channel spectrum of the sample (otherwise set to `NULL`).
#'     - `wavenumbers_sc_ref` If `"sc_ref"` was requested in the `type` option, a numeric vector of the wavenumbers of the single channel spectrum of the reference (otherwise set to `NULL`).

#'
#'  - If `simplify = TRUE`, a list of two elements is returned:
#'     - `wavenumbers`: Numeric vector with wavenumbers of the requested spectra.
#'     - `spectra`: Matrix with spectra of requested type (see argument `type`).
