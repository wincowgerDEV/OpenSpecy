## Reviewer comments

Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_OpenSpecy.html>.

Please correct before 2021-04-23 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

It seems we need to remind you of the CRAN policy:

'Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an informative message
if the resource is not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error).'

This needs correction whether or not the resource recovers.

The CRAN Team

> Sorry for the inconvenience. We reviewed CRAN's policy on source packages once
