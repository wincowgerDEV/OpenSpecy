<p>This document outlines a common workflow for using the Open Specy
package and app and highlights some topics that users are often
requesting a tutorial on. If the document is followed sequentially from
beginning to end, the user will have a better understanding of every
procedure involved in using the Open Specy R package and app as a tool
for interpreting spectra. It takes approximately 45 minutes to read
through and follow along with this standard operating procedure the
first time. Afterward, knowledgeable users should be able to thoroughly
analyze spectra at an average speed of 1 min<sup>-1</sup> or faster with
the new batch and automated procedures.</p>

<p>The Open Specy R package is the backbone of the Shiny app. The choice
is yours as to which you start with, we use both on a regular basis. The

<p>If you have your own data, click <strong>Browse</strong> at the top
left hand corner of the Analyze Spectra tab.</p>
<p><img src="app/mainpage.jpg" width="98%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Before uploading, indicate if you would like to share the uploaded
data or not using the slider. If selected, any data uploaded to the tool
will automatically be shared under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="external-link">CC-BY 4.0
license</a> and will be available for researchers and other ventures to
use to improve spectral analysis, build machine learning tools, etc.
Some users may choose not to share if they need to keep their data
private. If switched off, none of the uploaded data will be stored or
shared in Open Specy.</p>
<p><img src="app/uploadfile.jpg" width="137" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Open Specy allows for upload of native Open Specy .y(a)ml, .json, or
.rds files. In addition, .csv, .asp, .jdx, .0, .spa, .spc, and .zip
files can be imported. .zip files can either contain multiple files with
individual spectra in them of the non-zip formats or it can contain a
.hdr and .dat file that form an ENVI file for a spectral map. Open Specy
and .csv files should always load correctly but the other file types are
still in development, though most of the time these files work
perfectly. If uploading a .csv file, label the column with the
wavenumbers <code>wavenumber</code> and name the column with the
intensities <code>intensity</code>. Wavenumber units must be
cm<sup>-1</sup>. Any other columns are not used by the software. Always
keep a copy of the original file before alteration to preserve metadata
and raw data for your records.</p>

<p>It is best practice to cross check files in the proprietary software
they came from and Open Specy before use in Open Specy. Due to the
complexity of some proprietary file types, we haven’t been able to make
them fully compatible yet. If your file is not working, please contact
the administrator and share the file so that we can work on integrating
it.</p>
<p>The specific steps to converting your instrument’s native files to
.csv can be found in its software manual or you can check out <a href="https://www.effemm2.de/spectragryph/" class="external-link">Spectragryph</a>, which
supports many spectral file conversions (see Mini Tutorial section: File
conversion in Spectragryph to Open Specy accepted format).</p>
<p>The following line of code will read in your data when using the
package and interprets which reading function to use based on the file
extension.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_multi.html">read_any</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"path/to/your/data"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These file type specific functions will also read in spectral data
accordingly if you have a particular format in mind.</p>

<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_ext.html">read_text</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">".csv"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<p>If you don’t have your own data, you can use a test dataset.</p>
<p><img src="app/samplefile.jpg" width="134" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>A .csv file of an HDPE Raman spectrum will download on your computer.
This file can also be used as a template for formatting .csv data into
an Open Specy accepted format.</p>
<p>The following line of code does the same to load the example file
into R:</p>

<p>We also have many onboard files that you can call to test different
formats:</p>

<p>You will notice now that the R package reads in files into an object
with class <code>OpenSpecy</code>. This is a class we created for high
throughput spectral analysis which now also preserves spectral metadata.
You can even create these from scratch if you’d like:</p>

<p>In the app after spectral data are uploaded, it will appear in the
main window. This plot is selectable, zoomable, and provides information
on hover. You can also save a .png file of the plot view using the
camera icon at the top right when you hover over the plot.</p>
<p><img src="app/spectra_vis.jpg" width="210" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>In R, we have two ways to visualize your spectra, one is quick and
efficient and the other is interactive. Here is an example of quick and
efficient plotting.</p>

<p>Spectral maps can also be visualized as overlaid spectra but in
addition the spatial information can be plotted as a heatmap. A similar
plot should appear in the app if you upload multiple spectra or a
spectral map. It is important to note that when multiple spectra are
uploaded in batch they are prescribed <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
coordinates, this can be helpful for visualizing summary statistics and
navigating vast amounts of data but shouldn’t be confused with data
which actually has spatial coordinates. Hovering over the map will
reveal information about the signal and noise and correlation values.
Clicking the map will provide the selected spectrum underneath. In the
app, the colors of the heatmap are either the signal and noise or the
spectral identifications depending on whether the identification is
turned on or not. Pixels are black if the spectra does not pass the
signal-noise threshold and/or the correlation threshold.</p>
<p><img src="app/map_vis.jpg" width="210" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The same plot can be created in R but the user can control what
values form the colors of the heatmap by specifying <code>z</code>.</p>

<p>After uploading data, you can preprocess the data using intensity
adjustment, baseline subtraction, smoothing, flattening, and range
selection and save your preprocessed data. Once the process button is
selected the default processing will initiate. This is an absolute
derivative transformation, it is kind of magic, it does something
similar to smoothing, baseline subtraction, and intensity correction
simultaneously and really quickly. By clicking preprocessing you should
see the spectrum update with the processed spectra.</p>
<p><img src="app/processing.jpg" width="210" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>To view the raw data again, just deselect preprocessing. Toggling
preprocessing on and off can help you to make sure that the spectra are
processed correctly.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/process_spec.html">process_spec()</a></code> function is a monolithic function for
all processing procedures which is optimized by default to result in
high signal to noise in most cases, same as the app.</p>

<p>We want people to use the <code><a href="../reference/process_spec.html">process_spec()</a></code> function for
most processing operations, all processing functions can be tuned using
its parameters. However, we recognize that nesting of functions and
order of operations can be useful for users to control so you can also
use individual functions for each operation if you’d like.</p>

<h5 id="threshold-signal-noise">Threshold Signal-Noise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#threshold-signal-noise"></a>
</h5>
<p>Considering whether you have enough signal to analyze spectra is
important. Classical spectroscopy would recommend your highest peak to
be at least 10 times the baseline of your processed spectra before you
begin analysis. If your spectra is below that threshold, you may want to
consider recollecting it. In practice, we are rarely able to collect
spectra of that good quality and more often use 5. The Signal Over Noise
technique searches your spectra for high and low regions and conducts
division on them to derive the signal to noise ratio. Signal Times Noise
multiplies the mean signal by the standard deviation of the signal and
Total Signal sums the intensities. The latter can be really useful for
thresholding spectral maps to identify particles which we will discuss
later.</p>
<p><img src="app/snr_threshold.jpg" width="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>If analyzing spectra in batch, we recommend looking at the heatmap
and optimizing the percent of spectra that are above your signal to
noise threshold to determine the correct settings instead of looking
through spectra individually. Good Signal tells you what percent of your
data are above your signal threshold.</p>

uploads and the library spectra will be compatible. In code, we set the

</h5>
<p><img src="app/smoothingpoly.jpg" width="230" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The first step of the Open Specy preprocessing routing is spectral
smoothing. The goal of this function is to increase the signal to noise
ratio (S/N) without distorting the shape or relative size of the peaks.
The value on the slider is the polynomial order of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter" class="external-link">Savitzky-Golay
(SG) filter</a>. Higher numbers lead to more wiggly fits and thus less
smooth, lower numbers lead to more smooth fits. The SG filter is fit to
a moving window of 11 data points by default where the center point in
the window is replaced with the polynomial estimate. Larger windows will
produce smoother fits. The derivative order is set to 1 by default which
transforms the spectra to their first derivative. A zero order
derivative will have no derivative transformation. When smoothing is
done well, peak shapes and relative heights should not change. The
absolute value is primarily useful for first derivative spectra where
the absolute value results in an absorbance-like spectrum which is why
we set it as the default.</p>

</h5>
<p><img src="app/baselinecorrectionpoly.jpg" width="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The second step of Open Specy’s preprocessing routine is baseline
correction. The goal of baseline correction is to get all non-peak
regions of the spectra to zero absorbance. The higher the polynomial
order, the more wiggly the fit to the baseline. If the baseline is not
very wiggly, a more wiggly fit could remove peaks which is not desired.
The baseline correction algorithm used in Open Specy is called
“iModPolyfit” (Zhao et al. 2007). This algorithm iteratively fits
polynomial equations of the specified order to the whole spectrum.
During the first fit iteration, peak regions will often be above the
baseline fit. The data in the peak region is removed from the fit to
make sure that the baseline is less likely to fit to the peaks. The
iterative fitting terminates once the difference between the new and
previous fit is small. An example of a good baseline fit below. For
those who have been with OpenSpecy a while, you will notice the app no
longer supports manual baseline correction, it was a hard choice but it
just didn’t make sense to keep it now that we are moving toward high
throughput automated methods. It does still exist in the R function
though.</p>

<p>Sometimes an instrument operates with high noise at the ends of the
spectrum and, a baseline fit produces distortions, or there are regions
of interest for analysis. Range selection accomplishes those goals. You
should look into the signal to noise ratio of your specific instrument
by wavelength to determine what wavelength ranges to use. Distortions
due to baseline fit can be assessed from looking at the preprocess
spectra. Additionally, you can restrict the range to examine a single
peak or a subset of peaks of interests. The maximum and minimum
wavenumbers will specify the range to keep in the app. In the R
function, multiple ranges can be specified simultaneously.</p>

<p><img src="app/flattten_example.jpg" width="195" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Sometimes there are peaks that really shouldn’t be in your spectra
and can distort your interpretation of the spectra but you don’t
necessarily want to remove the regions from the analysis because you
believe those regions should be flat instead of having a peak. One way
to deal with this is to replace the peak values with the mean of the
values around the peak. This is the purpose of the
<code>flatten_range</code> function. By default it is set to flatten the
CO2 region for FTIR spectra because that region often needs to be
flattened when atmouspheric artefacts occur in spectra. Like
<code>restrict_range</code>, the R function can accept multiple
ranges.</p>

<p>Min-Max normalization is used throughout the app but is not one of
the options the user can specify. Often we regard spectral intensities
as arbitrary and min-max normalization allows us to view spectra on the
same scale without drastically distorting their shapes or relative peak
intensities. In the app, it is primarily used for plotting and as a
processing step before correlation analysis. In the package, most of the
processing functions will min-max transform your spectra relative by
default if you do not specify otherwise. This plot shows the two spectra
on such different scales that one looks like a straight line.</p>

<p>After uploading data and preprocessing it (if desired) you can now
identify the spectrum. To identify the spectrum go to the
<strong>Identification</strong> box. Pro tip: if you select
*Identification** without uploading data to the app, you’ll be able to
explore the library by itself.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="reading-libraries">Reading Libraries<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reading-libraries"></a>
</h4>
<p>These options define the strategy for identification. The ID Library
will inform which library is used. Both (default) will search both FTIR
and Raman libraries. Deriv will search against a derivative transformed
library. No Baseline will search against a baseline corrected library.
This should be in line with how you choose to process your spectra. Cor
options use a simple Pearson correlation search algorithm. AI is
currently experimental and uses either a multinomial model or
correlation on mediod spectra from the library. Correlation thresholding
will set the minimum value from matching to use as a ‘positive
identification’</p>
<p>In the R package, you’ll download and load the libraries into your
working environment.</p>
